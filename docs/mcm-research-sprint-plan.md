## Tips for Effective Research

### Note-Taking Strategy

1. **Use consistent format:**

   - Topic
   - Key points (bullet list)
   - Sources
   - Personal observations
   - Questions for further research

2. **Create visual references:**

   - Screenshots with annotations
   - Pinterest boards by category
   - Figma mood boards
   - Color palette files

3. **Document sources:**
   - Keep bibliography
   - Note page numbers
   - Save URLs with timestamps
   - Screenshot important passages

### Time Management

- Set timers for each session
- Take 10-minute breaks every hour
- Don't get lost in rabbit holes (set research boundaries)
- Prioritize breadth first, depth second
- Review daily progress each evening

### Collaboration

- Share discoveries in team chat
- Create shared Google Drive/Dropbox
- Use collaborative tools (Figma, Miro)
- Schedule daily sync (15 minutes)
- Divide and conquer topics

### Quality Over Quantity

- Better to deeply understand 10 pieces than superficially know 100
- Focus on "why" not just "what"
- Connect dots between research areas
- Look for patterns and themes
- Question assumptions
