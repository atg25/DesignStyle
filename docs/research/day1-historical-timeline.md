## Core Philosophy

### Bauhaus Influence (1919-1933)
German design school closed by Nazis. Faculty (Mies van der Rohe, Walter Gropius) emigrated to America, bringing:
- Form determined by function
- Rejection of ornament
- Industrial materials
- Democratic design

### Key Principles

1. **Function First** - Every element serves a purpose
2. **Simplicity** - Clean lines without ornament ("Less is more")
3. **Integration with Nature** - Organic forms, indoor-outdoor living
4. **Democratic Design** - Accessible to middle class through mass production
5. **Truth to Materials** - Celebrate material properties, show construction
6. **Modular & Flexible** - Adaptable to changing needs
