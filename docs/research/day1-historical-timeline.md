## Core Philosophy: "Form Follows Function"

### Origins & Influences

**Bauhaus Movement (1919-1933)**

- German design school closed by Nazis in 1933

- Brought modernist principles:
  - Unity of art and craft
  - Form determined by function
  - Rejection of ornament
  - Embrace of industrial materials
  - Democratic design (affordable for masses)

**Louis Sullivan's Principle (1896)**

- "Form ever follows function" - architectural maxim
- Building design should reflect its purpose
- Honest expression of structure
- No applied decoration

**Key Philosophical Tenets**

1. **Function First**

   - Every element serves a purpose
   - No purely decorative additions
   - Comfort and usability paramount
   - "Honest" design showing construction

2. **Simplicity**

   - Clean lines without ornament
   - Visual clarity
   - "Less is more" (Mies van der Rohe)
   - Reduce to essential elements

3. **Integration with Nature**

   - Organic forms inspired by nature
   - Indoor-outdoor living spaces
   - Natural materials (wood, leather, stone)
   - Large windows bringing outside in

4. **Democratic Design**

   - Good design accessible to middle class
   - Mass production enables affordability
   - Quality without luxury pricing
   - "The best for the most for the least" (Charles Eames)

5. **Human-Centric**

   - Ergonomic considerations
   - Comfort without sacrifice of aesthetics
   - Psychological comfort (enveloping chairs)
   - Adaptable to real life

6. **Truth to Materials**

   - Celebrate material properties
   - Don't disguise construction
   - Let wood look like wood
   - Show structural elements

7. **Modular & Flexible**
   - Pieces work in various configurations
   - Stackable, expandable, moveable
   - Adapt to changing needs
   - Multi-functional spaces
