# MCM Content Production & Writing Guidelines

**Day 9 Afternoon Session:** Editorial Standards & Voice  
**Created:** November 5, 2025  
**Purpose:** Define how to write content that educates and inspires

---

## Part 1: Brand Voice & Tone

### Voice Characteristics

**The MCM Design Hub voice is:**

1. **Knowledgeable but Accessible**

   - Expert without being academic
   - Explains complex ideas simply
   - Uses analogies from everyday life
   - Avoids jargon, or defines it clearly

2. **Enthusiastic but Not Gushing**

   - Genuine appreciation for good design
   - Lets the work speak for itself
   - Balanced critique when appropriate
   - Not everything is "iconic" or "revolutionary"

3. **Precise but Conversational**

   - Accurate dates, names, dimensions
   - Writes like talking to a friend
   - Uses contractions naturally
   - Maintains professional credibility

4. **Visual but Not Overwhelming**
   - Shows more than tells
   - Every image serves a purpose
   - Captions add value, not just describe
   - White space is intentional

### Voice Examples

**❌ Too Academic:**

> "The Eames Lounge Chair represents a paradigmatic synthesis of
> ergonomic functionality and aesthetic refinement, embodying the
> zeitgeist of post-war American optimism through its innovative
> application of thermoforming technology to laminated veneer lumber."

**❌ Too Casual:**

> "The Eames Lounge Chair is seriously so cool! It's like the ultimate
> chair ever made. Charles and Ray were total geniuses who created
> this amazing masterpiece that everyone loves."

**✅ Just Right:**

> "The Eames Lounge Chair combines comfort with elegance in a way
> that still feels fresh today. Charles and Ray Eames spent years
> perfecting their molded plywood technique—developed during WWII—
> to create those signature curved shells. The result? A chair that
> looks as good as it feels."

---

## Part 2: Writing Style Guidelines

### Sentence Structure

**Keep it Clear:**

```
✅ Good (Clear, Direct):
"The Eames Lounge Chair features molded plywood shells
upholstered in premium leather."

❌ Too Complex:
"Characterized by its utilization of thermoformed laminated
composite wood components, the seating apparatus incorporates
full-grain bovine hide covering materials."

❌ Too Simplistic:
"It has wood. It has leather. People sit on it."
```

**Vary Sentence Length:**

```
✅ Good Mix:
"Mid-century modern design changed everything. It rejected
ornate Victorian styles in favor of clean lines and honest
materials. Why? Post-war optimism demanded something new—
furniture that felt fresh, functional, and forward-thinking."

❌ All Long Sentences:
"Mid-century modern design represented a significant departure
from previous decorative traditions, emphasizing instead a
philosophy of simplicity and utility that resonated with the
cultural zeitgeist of the post-war era when consumers sought
furnishings that embodied a sense of progress and innovation."

❌ All Short Sentences:
"MCM design is simple. It uses clean lines. It avoids decoration.
It's functional. People liked it. It was new."
```

### Active vs. Passive Voice

**Prefer Active Voice:**

```
✅ Active (Direct, Engaging):
"Charles Eames designed the lounge chair in 1956."
"The chair combines molded plywood with leather upholstery."
"Designers embraced geometric forms."

❌ Passive (Indirect, Weak):
"The lounge chair was designed by Charles Eames in 1956."
"Molded plywood and leather are combined in the chair."
"Geometric forms were embraced by designers."
```

**When Passive Works:**

```
✅ Good Use of Passive:
"The chair was manufactured by Herman Miller from 1956 to present."
(Focus is on the chair and its ongoing production)

"This technique was developed during World War II."
(Historical context where actor is less important)

"The design is still produced today."
(Emphasizes continuity)
```

### Tense Usage

**Present Tense for Timeless Truths:**

```
✅ Present:
"The Eames Lounge Chair features molded plywood shells."
"Mid-century modern design emphasizes clean lines."
"The chair measures 32 inches tall."
```

**Past Tense for Historical Events:**

```
✅ Past:
"Charles and Ray Eames designed the chair in 1956."
"Herman Miller began production later that year."
"The design won the Triennale Gold Medal in 1960."
```

**Present Perfect for Lasting Impact:**

```
✅ Present Perfect:
"The Eames Lounge Chair has become an icon of American design."
"This style has influenced generations of designers."
"The piece has remained in continuous production since 1956."
```

## Part 3: Content Structure

### The Inverted Pyramid

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   Most Important Info   │  ← Hook + Key Facts
├─────────────────────────┤
│   Supporting Details    │  ← Context + Evidence
├─────────────────────────┤
│    Background Info      │  ← Additional Context
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Example Application:**

**Paragraph 1 (Hook + Key Facts):**

> "The Eames Lounge Chair (1956) remains one of the most recognizable
> pieces of furniture ever designed. Its combination of molded plywood
> and leather upholstery set a new standard for comfort and elegance."

**Paragraph 2 (Supporting Details):**

> "Charles and Ray Eames spent years perfecting their molded plywood
> technique, originally developed for medical splints during World War II.
> The chair's distinctive shell design uses multiple layers of veneer,
> shaped using heat and pressure, then paired with down-filled leather
> cushions."

**Paragraph 3 (Background):**

> "Herman Miller has manufactured the chair continuously since 1956,
> with only minor modifications to meet modern safety standards. Today's
> version remains remarkably faithful to the original design, testament
> to the Eameses' timeless vision."

### Headline Writing

**Effective Headlines:**

```
✅ Clear and Specific:
"The Eames Lounge Chair: Icon of Mid-Century Modern Design"
"How to Create an Authentic MCM Color Palette"
"5 Principles That Define Mid-Century Modern Style"

❌ Vague or Clickbait:
"This Chair Will Blow Your Mind"
"You Won't Believe What Makes MCM Special"
"The Secret Designers Don't Want You to Know"

❌ Too Generic:
"About the Eames Chair"
"Color Information"
"Design Principles"
```

**Headline Formula:**

```
[Number] + [Noun] + [Benefit/Promise]
"6 Typography Rules for Authentic MCM Design"

[How to] + [Achieve Desired Outcome]
"How to Identify Authentic Mid-Century Modern Furniture"

[Adjective] + [Noun] + [Context]
"Essential Materials for Mid-Century Modern Interiors"

[Noun]: [Promise]
"George Nelson: Master of Playful Functionality"
```

### Introduction Patterns

**Pattern 1: Question Opening**

> "What makes mid-century modern design so enduring? The answer lies
> in its radical simplicity. By stripping away ornament and focusing
> on function, designers like Charles Eames created pieces that feel
> as contemporary today as they did in 1956."

**Pattern 2: Bold Statement**

> "The Eames Lounge Chair changed everything. Before 1956, luxury
> seating meant heavy, ornate furniture. Charles and Ray Eames proved
> that comfort and elegance could coexist with clean, modern lines."

**Pattern 3: Surprising Fact**

> "Most people don't realize that the molded plywood technique used
> in the Eames Lounge Chair was originally developed for military
> medical equipment. The Eameses' work on leg splints during World
> War II laid the foundation for their most iconic furniture designs."

**Pattern 4: Scene Setting**

> "Picture a living room in 1956: clean lines, warm walnut wood,
> splashes of bold orange and teal. This is mid-century modern
> design at its peak—a style that rejected Victorian excess in
> favor of honest materials and functional beauty."

---

## Part 4: Educational Content Best Practices

### Teaching Complex Concepts

**Use the "Explain Like I'm 5" Test:**

**❌ Complex Explanation:**

> "The molded plywood process involves cross-laminating multiple
> veneers with thermosetting resin adhesives, then subjecting the
> assembly to elevated temperature and pressure conditions within
> a three-dimensional forming apparatus."

**✅ Simple Explanation:**

> "Making molded plywood is like making a layered sandwich. You
> stack thin sheets of wood with glue between them, then press the
> whole thing into a curved mold while heating it. The heat makes
> the glue harden, and you end up with a strong, smooth curve that
> holds its shape."

### Analogy Techniques

**Good Analogies Connect to Familiar Concepts:**

```
✅ Effective Analogies:

"Think of color in MCM design like seasoning in cooking—use too
much and it's overwhelming, but the right amount makes everything
else shine."

"A mid-century modern room is like a well-edited photo. You remove
everything that doesn't serve the composition, leaving only what's
essential."

"The Eames approach to furniture was like Apple's approach to
technology: make it beautiful, make it functional, and hide all
the complexity."
```

### Progressive Complexity

**Layer Information Gradually:**

**Level 1 (Beginner):**

> "The Eames Lounge Chair has curved wooden shells covered in leather."

**Level 2 (Intermediate):**

> "The Eames Lounge Chair features molded plywood shells—made from
> multiple layers of thin wood veneer pressed into curves—upholstered
> with premium leather."

**Level 3 (Advanced):**

> "The Eames Lounge Chair employs a five-layer rosewood veneer
> lamination process, utilizing radio-frequency adhesive curing
> within compound-curved aluminum forms. The shells accept full-grain
> aniline-dyed leather with polyurethane foam cores and down-fill
> overlays, mounted to a die-cast aluminum five-star base."

### Visual Learning Support

**Always Pair Text with Visuals:**

<figure class="annotated-diagram">
  <img src="eames-chair-anatomy.svg" alt="Eames Chair components" />
  <figcaption>
    <ol class="diagram-labels">

## Part 5: Accessibility in Writing

### Plain Language Principles

**Use Simple Words:**

```
✅ Simple:
use → instead of → utilize
help → instead of → facilitate
about → instead of → approximately
show → instead of → demonstrate

✅ Good:
"This chair uses molded plywood."

❌ Unnecessarily Complex:
"This seating apparatus utilizes thermoformed laminated veneer."
```

### Reading Level Target

**Aim for 8th-10th Grade Reading Level:**

**Tools to Check:**

- Hemingway Editor
- Readable.com
- Microsoft Word readability statistics

**Techniques:**

- Average sentence length: 15-20 words
- Vary between 10-30 words
- One main idea per sentence
- Break complex ideas into multiple sentences

**Example:**

```
❌ Too Complex (Grade 14+):
"The Eames Lounge Chair, which represents a paradigmatic synthesis
of ergonomic functionality and aesthetic refinement through its
innovative application of thermoforming technology to laminated
veneer lumber, has become an enduring icon of American design."

✅ Appropriate (Grade 9):
"The Eames Lounge Chair has become an American design icon. It
combines comfort with elegance through its molded plywood
construction. The technique uses multiple layers of thin wood
veneer, shaped using heat and pressure."
```

### Clear Information Hierarchy

**Use Headings Effectively:**

```html
<article>
  <h1>The Eames Lounge Chair</h1>

  <h2>Design History</h2>
  <p>Created in 1956...</p>

  <h3>Early Prototypes</h3>
  <p>The first versions...</p>

  <h3>Final Production Model</h3>
  <p>Herman Miller began...</p>

  <h2>Construction Details</h2>
  <p>The chair consists of...</p>

  <h3>Shell Components</h3>
  <p>Three separate shells...</p>

  <h3>Upholstery Process</h3>
  <p>Premium leather is...</p>
</article>
```

**Visual Hierarchy Checklist:**

- ✅ Only one H1 per page
- ✅ Headings follow logical order (don't skip levels)
- ✅ Headings describe the following content
- ✅ Each section can stand alone
- ✅ Scannable with headings alone

## Part 6: Image Guidelines

### Photo Standards

**Technical Requirements:**

```yaml
Format:
  Primary: WebP
  Fallback: JPEG

Dimensions:
  Hero Images: 1600px × 900px minimum
  Gallery Images: 1200px × 800px minimum
  Thumbnails: 400px × 300px minimum

Quality:
  JPEG: 85%
  WebP: 80%

Optimization:
  - Compress with ImageOptim or similar
  - Strip EXIF data
  - Use progressive loading
  - Implement lazy loading

Alt Text:
  - Describe what's shown, not "image of"
  - Include designer/year for furniture
  - Be specific: "Eames Lounge Chair in walnut and black leather"
  - Keep under 125 characters
```

**Photographic Style:**

```
✅ Good Photos:
- Clean, uncluttered backgrounds
- Natural lighting when possible
- Multiple angles (front, side, detail)
- Context shots (in actual rooms)
- High resolution and sharp focus
- Accurate color representation

❌ Poor Photos:
- Busy, distracting backgrounds
- Heavy filters or artificial effects
- Single angle only
- Studio-only shots (no context)
- Blurry or low resolution
- Color-shifted or over-processed
```

### Captions That Add Value

**❌ Descriptive Only:**

> "Eames Lounge Chair"

**❌ Too Verbose:**

> "This photograph depicts a mid-century modern seating apparatus
> known as the Eames Lounge Chair, designed by Charles and Ray Eames
> in the year 1956, featuring molded plywood construction with leather
> upholstery mounted on an aluminum base."

**✅ Informative and Concise:**

> "Eames Lounge Chair (1956) in walnut and black leather. The molded
> plywood shells took years to perfect."

**✅ Educational Context:**

> "Early prototype showing the rubber shock mounts between shells—a
> key innovation that allows the chair to flex with the sitter's weight."

      button.textContent = "Copied!";
      setTimeout(() => {
        button.textContent = "Copy";
      }, 2000);
    });
  }
</script>
```

### Interactive Demos

**Provide Context and Controls:**

```html
<div class="interactive-demo">
  <div class="demo-header">
    <h3>Typography Scale Demo</h3>
    <p>Adjust the modular scale ratio to see how it affects type sizes</p>
  </div>

  <div class="demo-controls">
    <label>
      Scale Ratio:
      <input
        type="range"
        min="1.1"
        max="1.5"
        step="0.05"
        value="1.25"
        oninput="updateScale(this.value)"
      />
      <output id="scaleValue">1.25</output>

    <label>
      Base Size:

        max="20"
        value="16"

    <div class="type-sample" data-level="lg">Large (1.25rem)</div>
    <div class="type-sample" data-level="xl">Extra Large (1.563rem)</div>
    <div class="type-sample" data-level="2xl">2X Large (1.953rem)</div>
  </div>

  <div class="demo-explanation">
    <h4>How It Works</h4>
    <p>
      A modular scale creates harmonious type sizes by multiplying the base size
      by a consistent ratio. MCM designers often used ratios like 1.25 (Major
      Third) or 1.333 (Perfect Fourth) to create visual rhythm.
