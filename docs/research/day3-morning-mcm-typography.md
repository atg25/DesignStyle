# Mid-Century Modern Typography

## Core Principles
- Clarity over decoration
- Grid-based layouts
- Asymmetric composition
- Negative space is active
- Hierarchy through size/weight, not ornament
- Sans-serif dominance

## THE MCM Typefaces

### Helvetica (1957) - THE Icon
**Designer:** Max Miedinger & Eduard Hoffmann  
**Origin:** Haas Type Foundry, Switzerland

**Features:**
- Horizontal terminals on C, G, S
- Square dots on i, j
- Large x-height
- Tight spacing

**Famous usage:** American Airlines (1967), NYC Subway (1970), Herman Miller catalogs

### Futura (1927) - Geometric Perfection
**Designer:** Paul Renner  
**Origin:** Bauer Type Foundry, Germany  
**Status:** Pre-MCM but huge in MCM era

- Pointed apex on A, M, N
- Single-story a with distinctive tail

### Univers (1957) - Swiss Precision
**Designer:** Adrian Frutiger  
**Status:** Helvetica's sophisticated cousin

**Why mattered:**
- First systematic weight/width family (21 fonts)
- More elegant than Helvetica
- More open apertures
- Popular in European MCM

### Akzidenz-Grotesk (1896) - Helvetica's Grandfather
**Origin:** Berthold Type Foundry  
**Status:** Original "Swiss" typeface that inspired Helvetica

## Serif Typefaces

### Garamond (1530s)
**Usage:** Body text when refinement needed  
**Why:** Pairs with sans-serif headlines, elegant, excellent readability

### Bodoni (1790s)
**Usage:** Headlines, fashion, luxury  
**Why:** High contrast (thick/thin strokes), dramatic, sophisticated

**Features:** Extreme contrast, vertical stress, unbracketed serifs

### Caslon (1720s)
**Usage:** Rare, traditional contexts  
**Why:** American heritage (Declaration of Independence), warm, versatile

## Late MCM (1965-1970)

### Cooper Black (1922)
**Usage:** Advertising, children's products, psychedelic era  
**Why:** Friendly rounded forms, counterculture rejection of Swiss precision

## Typography Principles

### Hierarchy Without Ornament
- Size, weight, space only
- No drop shadows, outlines, gradients, decorative underlines
- Multiple weights of same typeface

### Generous White Space
- Line height: 1.6-1.8 for body text
- Tight (1.1-1.2) for large headlines
- Space between paragraphs (not indentation)

### Letter Spacing
- Uppercase: ADD spacing (0.1-0.2em)
- Large headlines: REDUCE slightly (-0.02em)
- Body text: Leave default
- Small caps: ADD spacing (0.05em)

### Alignment
- Left-aligned default
- Centered for headlines only
- Justified avoided (creates rivers)
- Right-aligned rare

## Classic Pairings

1. **All Helvetica** - Headlines + body (most common)
2. **Futura + Garamond** - Sans headlines + serif body (sophisticated)
3. **Swiss System** - Helvetica with mathematical modular scale

## Note on Bebas Neue

Bebas Neue (2005) is NOT an authentic MCM typeface. It's a modern interpretation created 35+ years after MCM period ended (1945-1970). While suitable for MCM-inspired contemporary designs, it has no historical connection to the movement.
