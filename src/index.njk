        <p class="principle__text">
          "Form follows function" was the mantra. Every element served a purpose. Unnecessary ornamentation was
          eliminated in favor of clean, purposeful design that communicated directly and efficiently.

        <h3 class="principle__title">Bold Use of Color</h3>
        <p class="principle__text">
          MCM designers weren't afraid of color. They used vibrant, saturated hues alongside earthy tones—think burnt
          orange, avocado green, turquoise, and mustard yellow. These optimistic colors reflected the prosperity and
          innovation of the era.

        <div class="principle__number">03</div>
        <h3 class="principle__title">Geometric Patterns & Shapes</h3>
        <p class="principle__text">
          Atomic-age science inspired designers to use geometric patterns extensively. Starbursts, circles, diamonds,
          and angular shapes created dynamic, energetic compositions. These patterns often represented atoms, molecules,
          and the excitement of space exploration.

        <h3 class="principle__title">Sans-Serif Typography</h3>
        <p class="principle__text">
          Clean, geometric sans-serif typefaces like Helvetica (1957), Futura (1927), and Univers (1957) became
          dominant. These fonts emphasized clarity and modernity, rejecting ornate traditional typefaces for streamlined
          communication.

        <h3 class="principle__title">Asymmetrical Balance</h3>
        <p class="principle__text">
          Breaking from traditional centered layouts, MCM designers embraced asymmetry and white space. They created
          visual tension through off-center compositions, diagonal elements, and bold contrasts that guided the viewer's
          eye dynamically across the page.

      <h2 class="section__title">Why MCM Design Still Matters</h2>

      <div class="conclusion__content">
        <p class="conclusion__text">
          Mid-Century Modern graphic design wasn't just about aesthetics—it was a philosophy. The movement proved that
          good design is clear, functional, and accessible. By stripping away unnecessary ornamentation, MCM designers
          created visual communication that was both beautiful and effective.
        </p>

        <p class="conclusion__text">
          Today, we see MCM principles everywhere: in tech company logos that favor simple geometric shapes, in web
          design that embraces white space and sans-serif typography, and in branding that values clarity over
          complexity. The movement's emphasis on "form follows function" remains the foundation of modern design
          thinking.
        </p>

        <blockquote class="conclusion__quote">
          <p class="quote__text">
            "Design is the silent ambassador of your brand."
          </p>
          <cite class="quote__author">— Paul Rand</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p class="conclusion__text">
          The enduring appeal of MCM graphic design lies in its timelessness. By focusing on fundamental principles
          rather than trends, these designers created work that remains relevant decades later. Whether you're designing
          a logo, a poster, or a website, the lessons of the Mid-Century Modern era—simplicity, clarity, bold use of
          color, and geometric precision—continue to guide effective visual communication.
